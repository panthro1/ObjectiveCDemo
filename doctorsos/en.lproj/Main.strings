DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nARBITRATION\nYou agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, \"Disputes\") will be settled by binding arbitration between you and SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL , except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \"Dispute Resolution\" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this \"Dispute Resolution\" section will survive any termination of these Terms.\n\nARBITRATION RULES AND GOVERNING LAW\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \"AAA Rules\") then in effect, except as modified by this \"Dispute Resolution\" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\n\nARBITRATION PROCESS\nA party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n\nARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE\nUnless you and SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n\nARBITRATOR'S DECISION\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the \"Limitation of Liability\" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  will not seek, and hereby waives all rights SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  prevail in arbitration.\n\nFEES\nYour responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n\nCHANGES\nNotwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if Company changes this \"Dispute Resolution\" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL  written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL Inc., Attn: --------------------------------??---------------------------------------or by email from the email address associated with your Account to: change-dr@SOS DOCTOR HOUSECALL .com, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \"Last update\" date above.
