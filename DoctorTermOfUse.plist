•	Arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you may bring against the Company.
   Agreeing to arbitration only affects where any such claims may be brought and how they will be    resolved.
 
•	Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil judge, or a jury.  Instead, the parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties using the process set forth herein.  Other arbitration rules and procedures are also set forth herein.

•	Unless the law requires otherwise, as determined by the Arbitrator based upon the circumstances presented, you will be required to split the cost of any arbitration with the Company.

If the Parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then an arbitrator will be selected using the alternate strike method from a list of five (5) neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration &amp; Mediation Services).  You will have the option of making the first strike.  If a JAMS arbitrator is used, then the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures rules will apply.  Those rules are available here:

http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-­‐streamlined-­‐arbitration/

The location of the arbitration proceeding shall be no more than 45 miles from the place where you last provided Medical House Calls under this Agreement, unless each party to the arbitration agrees in writing otherwise.

iv.           Starting The Arbitration.

          All claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes of limitation that would apply in court.  The party bringing the claim must demand arbitration in writing and deliver the written demand by hand or first class mail to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period.  The demand for arbitration shall include identification of the Parties, a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim(s), and a specification of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration made to the Company or &quot;The Company&quot; shall be provided to Legal, SOSDHC LLC,(address.............?) .  The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.
A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such provisional relief.

v.        How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted.

In arbitration, the Parties will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the Arbitrator.

You and the Company agree to resolve any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective, or private attorney general representative action basis. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis.  If at any point this provision is determined to be unenforceable, the parties agree that this provision shall not be severable, unless it is determined that the Arbitration may still proceed on an individual basis only.

While the Company will not take any retaliatory action in response to any exercise of rights you may have under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if any, the Company shall not be precluded from moving to enforce its rights under the FAA to compel arbitration on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

vi.        Paying For The Arbitration.

Each party will pay the fees for his, her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law (i.e., a party prevails on a claim that provides for the award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party).  In all cases where required by law, the Company will pay the Arbitrator&apos;s and arbitration fees. If under applicable law the Company is not required to pay all
of the Arbitrator’s and/or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned equally between the Parties or as otherwise required by applicable law. Any disputes in that regard will be resolved by the Arbitrator.

vii.       The Arbitration Hearing And Award.

The Parties will arbitrate their dispute before the Arbitrator, who shall confer with the Parties regarding the conduct of the hearing and resolve any disputes the Parties may have in that regard.  Within 30 days of the close of the arbitration hearing, or within a longer period of time as agreed to by the Parties or as ordered by the Arbitrator, any party will have the right to prepare, serve on the other party and file with the Arbitrator a brief.  The Arbitrator may award any party any remedy to which that party is entitled under applicable law, but such remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in
his or her individual capacity in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the Arbitrator, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual in a court of law will be forfeited by virtue of this Arbitration Provision.  The Arbitrator will issue a decision or award in writing, stating the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Except as may be permitted or required by law, as determined by the Arbitrator, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all Parties.  A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter a judgment upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration.  The Arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.

            By entering into this Agreement, you agree to defend, indemnify, protect and hold harmless the Company, its licensors and each such party’s parent organizations, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, members, employees, attorneys and agents, from any and all claims, demands, damages, suits, losses, liabilities, expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs), and causes of action arising directly or indirectly from out of or in connection with (a) your actions (or omissions) arising from the performance of services under this Agreement, including personal injury or death to any person (including you and/or your employees); (b) liability for civil and/or criminal conduct (e.g., assault, battery, fraud); (c) any liability arising from your failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including with respect to payment of wages, benefits or expenses due your employees, agents, or subcontractors; and (d) your use (or misuse) of the Software or Service.


Damage or Injury Claims

 You shall be liable to the User/Patient for all claims of damage and/or injury to any User/Patient sustained while being seen by you.  You agree to notify the Company of any damage or injury as soon as practicable after the damage or injury occurs.  You understand that the Company does not provide insurance coverage for damage or personal injury.  

  You agree to fully cooperate with the User/Patient and/or the Company to resolve injury or damage claims as quickly as possible.

  You agree that, in the event the Company is held liable for any injury or damage to any person caused by you, the Company shall have the right to recover such amount from you.  Similarly, should the Company voluntarily elect to pay any amount owed to any person for damage or injury to that person caused by you or for which you are responsible and/or liable, the Company shall have the same right as the injured party to recover from you (i.e., the Company stands in the shoes of the injured party).

Arbitration Provision

Important Note Regarding this Arbitration provision:

•	Arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you may bring against the Company.
   Agreeing to arbitration only affects where any such claims may be brought and how they will be    resolved.
 
•	Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil judge, or a jury.  Instead, the parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties using the process set forth herein.  Other arbitration rules and procedures are also set forth herein.

•	Unless the law requires otherwise, as determined by the Arbitrator based upon the circumstances presented, you will be required to split the cost of any arbitration with the Company.

•	IMPORTANT: This arbitration provision will require you to resolve any claim that you may have against the Company or SOSDHC LLC, on an individual basis pursuant to the terms of the Agreement unless you choose to opt out of the arbitration provision. This provision will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against the Company or SOSDHC LLC,. It also precludes you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, or representative action brought against the Company or &quot;The Company&quot; by someone else.

    However, as discussed above, if you agree to arbitration, you will not be precluded from bringing your claims against the Company or Swurvin LLC, in an individual arbitration proceeding. If successful on such claims, you could be awarded money or other relief by an arbitrator (subject to splitting the cost of arbitration as mentioned above).


WHETHER TO AGREE TO ARBITRATION IS AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS DECISION. IT IS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RELY SOLELY UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT AS IT IS NOT INTENDED TO CONTAIN A COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF ABRITRATION. YOU SHOULD TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO CONDUCT FURTHER
RESEARCH AND TO CONSULT WITH OTHERS — INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
AN ATTORNEY — REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR DECISION, JUST AS
YOU WOULD WHEN MAKING ANY OTHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS OR LIFE
DECISION.

i.          How This Arbitration Provision Applies.

This Arbitration Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) and evidences a transaction involving commerce.  This Arbitration Provision applies to any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or termination of the Agreement and survives after the Agreement terminates.  Nothing contained in this Arbitration Provision shall be construed to prevent or excuse you from utilizing any procedure for resolution of complaints established in this Agreement (if any), and this Arbitration Provision is not intended to be a substitute for the utilization of such procedures.

Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before a forum other than arbitration. This Arbitration Provision requires all such disputes to be resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis only and not by way of court or jury trial, or by way of class, collective, or representative action.

Such disputes include without limitation disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision.  All such matters shall be decided by an Arbitrator and not by a court or judge.

            Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision also applies, without limitation, to disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and disputes arising out of or related to your relationship with the Company, including termination of the relationship.  This Arbitration Provision also applies, without limitation, to disputes regarding any city, county, state or federal wage-­‐hour law, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, expense reimbursement, termination, harassment and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor
             Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by the Company and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or funded by insurance), Genetic Information Non-­‐Discrimination Act, and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other similar federal and state statutory and common law claims.

This Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or dispute that lawfully can be arbitrated, except for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this Agreement are expressly excluded from the Arbitration Provision.

            The parties expressly agree that &quot;The Company&quot; is an intended third-­‐party beneficiary of this Arbitration Provision.

ii.         Limitations On How This Agreement Applies.

The disputes and claims set forth below shall not be subject to arbitration and the requirement to arbitrate set forth in this Arbitration Provision shall not apply:
Claims for workers compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; Regardless of any other terms of this Arbitration Provision, claims may be brought before and remedies
awarded by an administrative agency if applicable law permits access to such an agency notwithstanding
the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.  Such administrative claims include without limitation claims or charges brought before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (www.eeoc.gov), the U.S. Department of Labor (www.dol.gov), the National Labor Relations Board (www.nlrb.gov), or the Officeof Federal Contract Compliance Programs (www.dol.gov/esa/ofccp).   Nothing in this Arbitration Provision shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party&apos;s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration;

Disputes that may not be subject to predispute arbitration agreement as provided by the Dodd-­‐Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-­‐203) are excluded from the coverage of this Arbitration Provision;

           Disputes regarding your, the Company’s, or SOS Doctor HouseCall intellectual property rights;

This Arbitration Provision shall not be construed to require the arbitration of any claims against a contractor that may not be the subject of a mandatory arbitration agreement as provided by section
8116 of the Department of Defense (&quot;DoD&quot;) Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Pub. L. 111-­‐118), section 8102 of the Department of Defense (&quot;DoD&quot;) Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Pub. L. 112-­‐10, Division A), and their implementing regulations, or any successor DoD appropriations act addressing the arbitrability of claims.

iii.	Selecting The Arbitrator and Location of the Arbitration.

The Arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the Company and you.  Unless you and the Company mutually agree otherwise, the Arbitrator shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the location where the arbitration proceeding will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted.  If the Parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then an arbitrator will be selected using the alternate strike method from a list of five (5) neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration &amp; Mediation Services).  You will have the option of making the first strike.  If a JAMS arbitrator is used, then the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures rules will apply.  Those rules are available here:

http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-­‐streamlined-­‐arbitration/

The location of the arbitration proceeding shall be no more than 45 miles from the place where you last provided Medical House Calls under this Agreement, unless each party to the arbitration agrees in writing otherwise.

iv.           Starting The Arbitration.

          All claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes of limitation that would apply in court.  The party bringing the claim must demand arbitration in writing and deliver the written demand by hand or first class mail to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period.  The demand for arbitration shall include identification of the Parties, a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim(s), and a specification of the remedy sought. Any demand for arbitration made to the Company or &quot;The Company&quot; shall be provided to Legal, SOSDHC LLC,(address.............?) .  The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.
A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such provisional relief.

v.        How Arbitration Proceedings Are Conducted.

In arbitration, the Parties will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the Arbitrator.

You and the Company agree to resolve any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective, or private attorney general representative action basis. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis.  If at any point this provision is determined to be unenforceable, the parties agree that this provision shall not be severable, unless it is determined that the Arbitration may still proceed on an individual basis only.

While the Company will not take any retaliatory action in response to any exercise of rights you may have under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if any, the Company shall not be precluded from moving to enforce its rights under the FAA to compel arbitration on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

vi.        Paying For The Arbitration.

Each party will pay the fees for his, her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law (i.e., a party prevails on a claim that provides for the award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party).  In all cases where required by law, the Company will pay the Arbitrator&apos;s and arbitration fees. If under applicable law the Company is not required to pay all
of the Arbitrator’s and/or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned equally between the Parties or as otherwise required by applicable law. Any disputes in that regard will be resolved by the Arbitrator.

vii.       The Arbitration Hearing And Award.

The Parties will arbitrate their dispute before the Arbitrator, who shall confer with the Parties regarding the conduct of the hearing and resolve any disputes the Parties may have in that regard.  Within 30 days of the close of the arbitration hearing, or within a longer period of time as agreed to by the Parties or as ordered by the Arbitrator, any party will have the right to prepare, serve on the other party and file with the Arbitrator a brief.  The Arbitrator may award any party any remedy to which that party is entitled under applicable law, but such remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in
his or her individual capacity in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the Arbitrator, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual in a court of law will be forfeited by virtue of this Arbitration Provision.  The Arbitrator will issue a decision or award in writing, stating the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Except as may be permitted or required by law, as determined by the Arbitrator, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all Parties.  A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter a judgment upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration.  The Arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.

viii.	Your Right To Opt Out Of Arbitration.

             Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of your contractual relationship with the Company.  If you do not want to be subject to this Arbitration Provision, you may opt out of this Arbitration Provision by notifying the Company in writing of your desire to opt out of this Arbitration Provision, either by (1) sending, within 30 days of the date this Agreement is executed by you, electronic mail to optout@SOSDHC LLC,.com, stating your name and intent to opt out of the Arbitration Provision or (2) by sending a letter by U.S. Mail, or by any nationally recognized delivery service (e.g, UPS, Federal Express, etc.), or by hand delivery to:
